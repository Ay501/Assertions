        <h1>POULTRY SECTION</h1>

        <p>This is the scetion that deals with the general state and wellbeing of terrestial birds.Birds can majorly be divided into the following,</p>

        <p>1.Layers</p>
        <p>2.Broilers</p>
        <p>3.Turkeys</p>
        <p>4.Cockrels etc</p>

    </div>
    <div class="section2">
        <h2>LAYERS</h2>

        <P>These are known as lying birds. They are breeded for the main purpose of of producing eggs. They have high resistance to diseses and are very easy to raise. The fact that they have high resistnce to diseases does not mean these birds are immune
            to diseases. These birds are highly profittable in the sense that at old age, they can be sold way more than the amount used in buying them.</P>
        <p>These eggs are sold in either paper or plastic crates</p>
        <p>NOTE- Layers can lay for more than a year and six months and are not so big in size.<br> Water (H<sub>2</sub>O) is very vital to their growth at 30<sup>o</sup>C They are often referred to as <i> <strong style="color: greenyellow;"> <mark>NATIVE FOWL </mark> </strong> </i>            </p>
        <p>Also in should be emphatically noted that layers are very sensitive to the feeding system adopted by the livestock farmer. If there is an change in the brand of feed at any time, it will affect the laying capacity of the birds. Also, if there
            is a change in the time of feeding, it will still affect their laying capacity</p>

        <h3>BROILERS</h3>

        <p>These are the set of birds breeded for the main purpose of producing meeat. They are breeded for a span of four to five months as the case may be. Mind you, they can also be raised for a longer life span</p>
        <p>They are mostly white in colour. If these set of birds are grown for some time, they become what we refer to as <em> <b> PARENT COCK AND HENS </b> respectively </em> </p>

    <div class="section4">
        <h4>TURKEYS</h4>

        <P>These are also grown or breeded for meat production but these class are relatively bigger than the other birds. They are very expensive to raise and are also very expensive to sell after breeding life </P>
        <p>Turkeys can be divided into two;</p>
        <P>1. Agric Turkeys</P>
        <P>2. Native Turkeys</P>

        <p>These are the smallest of them but also the strongest of them all. They are very stong and can survive anywhere </p>
